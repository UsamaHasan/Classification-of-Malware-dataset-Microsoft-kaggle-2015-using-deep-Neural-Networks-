# Classification-of-Malware-dataset-Microsoft-kaggle-2015-using-deep-Neural-Networks-
 This repository contains one of the many models I trained while classifying malware classes provided by Microsoft in 2015 Kaggle challenge. This was part of my bachelors final year research thesis. ANN, CNN and autoencoders were trained and fined tuned. Further results were also obtained using transfer learning on VGG16 model.
